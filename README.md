- Open the source code in Android Studio
- Switch the project explorer to 'Project'
- In the root of the project create a new file called 'apikey.properties'
- Inside the file type: API_KEY = "API_KEY_HERE"
- Build the project

If successful the project should have an entry in the BuildConfig class. (Type BuildConfig.API_KEY in source code, if a match is found it was imported successfully)
